    After Action Review:
      The collection of donations and the managing of parking for the festival went well.
      Parking attendants showed up on time and the top lot was sold en masse to the owner of Quaker Steak for their use.
      The Boy Scout Troop 3 pulled 6 (maybe 7) shifts.  
        
      The parking attendant signup was handled using https://signup.com.  Make sure to include links to the signup sheet whenever 
        it is referenced in a communication.
      
      The Goode Street entrance was blocked with saw horses from [DPW?]

      The Cumberland St entrance was narrowed to one lane in order to slow traffic and provide a location for the attendant to park.

      The parking attendant had a yellow safety smock to wear.

      The carts used by the festival used the parking lot as a cut through.  The Goode Street entrance was left open at 
        least once from this traffic.
      
      Library patrons on several occasions dropped off books to be deposited in the book drop. (Not a problem, but not optimal either)

      5 parking spots were reserved for the library staff

      The hours of the operation were 
      Setup - Thursday evening to block the entrances
      Friday
      Saturday
      Sunday
      Tear Down - Sunday evening - moved barriers to the grass and off sidewalk.
